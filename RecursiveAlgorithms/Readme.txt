The code files given here are all written in MATLAB mfile syntax.

They are used to obtain Kinematic and Dynamic model parameters used in "Robust Locomotion Control of a Self-Balancing and Underactuated
Bipedal Exoskeleton: Task Prioritization and Feedback Control" scintefic paper.

Run main.m file to generate the kinematic and dynamic model for an arbitrary selected posture.
