# Robust-Locomotion-Control-of-a-Self-Balancing-and-Underactuated-Bipedal-Exoskeleton-Task-Prioritiza
In this research, we aim for robust locomotion control of an underactuated bipedal exoskeleton with arbitrary human users. To ensure robust and dynamic walking behavior despite parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, we synthesized three distinct controllers, namely, Centroidal Momentum Control (CMC), Basic Admittance Controller (BAC), and ZMP Impedance Feedback (ZIF). In order to understand the best performing controller, we ran several simulations with 12 distinct anthropomorphic subjects concerning two walking scenarios, 1) perturbation free dynamic walking, 2) perturbed dynamic walking. The results are statistically analyzed.
